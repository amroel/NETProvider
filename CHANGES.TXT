* Removed the limitiation of one DataReader per connection.
(Now you can have many DataReader's per connection and only
one per command).

* Changes on Database schema support:
    
	* All source files has been renamed to remove
	the Schema suffix (FbTablesSchema.cs -> FbTables.cs)
	The same for the class names.

	* There are a new 'Restrictions' schema that will
	return the restriction columns for each schema.

	* There are new columns in some schemas:

		XXXX_CATALOG
		XXXX_SCHEMA

	That will make the returned schemas more
	general and compatible with other databases
	(what will be nice for .net 2.0 as the schema
	support is in the System.Data.Common.DbConnection
	class)

	These new columns are restriction columns as
	well (the value will be null always) 		

	* New schemas.

		- DataTypes. Returns the data types information.

		- MetaDataCollections. Returns all the supported schemas, 
		and the number of restrictions of each one

		- Restrictions. Returns the restriction columns of each schema.

        * New FbConnection methods.

            - GetChema()
            - GetSchema(string)
            - GetSchema(string[])

        * Changes on the names of the FbDbSchemaType elements to remove the underscore.

        ** Some of the changes in the Schema Results are: **
	
	* Columns Schema.

        	- The COLUMN_DATA_TYPE now holds the datatype name.

	        - Added new IS_ARRAY column.
           
        	- Removed PROVIDER_TYPE, PRIMARY_KEY and UNIQUE_KEY columns.
		(The reason is that the query with that columsn gets a lot time to be executed 
		in databases with complex metadata)

        * Tables schema.

	        - The IS_SYSTEM_TABLE column now will have aloways 0/1 as values.

		- Not it's no possible to filter by the IS_SYSTEM_TABLE column,
		instead filter by TABLE_TYPE can be done using:

			a. TABLE
			b. VIEW
			c. SYSTEM TABLE

	* Domains Schema.

        	- The COLUMN_DATA_TYPE now holds the datatype name.

	* ProcedureParameters Schema.

        	- The COLUMN_DATA_TYPE now holds the datatype name.

	* ViewColumnUsage Schema.

        	- The COLUMN_DATA_TYPE now holds the datatype name.

        * Generators schema.

	        * The IS_SYSTEM_GENERATOR column now will have always 0/1 as values.

        * Functions schema.

	        * The IS_SYSTEM_FUNCTION column now will have always 0/1 as values.

        * Triggers schema.

	        * The IS_SYSTEM_TRIGGER column now will have always 0/1 as values.

	* ForeignKeys schema:

		* The order of the restriction columns is changed:

                    1. PK_TABLE_CATALOG
                    2. PK_TABLE_SCHEMA
                    3. PK_TABLE_NAME
                    4. FK_TABLE_CATALOG
                    5. FK_TABLE_SCHEMA
